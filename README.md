# guess-the-number
Project in perl to guess the right number for the user

In this project, you will choose a random number 1-100, ask the user for an input.  
Compare this on the input and the number you entered.  From there, tell the user to either go higher or lower. 
The user will know the number of guesses it took them to figure out the guess and the message.
